## Installation

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GuiiHenriq/checkout-enjoei.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install - Make sure it's in the project folder (this process takes 15 ~ 20 seconds)
```

Take a test:

```sh
node test - It is possible that errors appear in ESLint itself, just ignore, skip this action (Ctrl + C) and proceed to the next step (this process takes 05 ~ 15 seconds)
```

Start node and run the application:

```sh
node server.js
```
 
  
## Test, Test, Test

I used the "node test" or "npm test" itself to check bugs and fix any problems.
Recommendation: Turn the "npm test" command before running the application, It is possible that errors appear in ESLint itself, just ignore and skip this action (Ctrl + C).
