# Checkout Enjoei
> Enjoei ![](static/img/logo.png)

This application has the objective of simulating the checkout process of Enjoei!

**_Attention: Make sure you have NodeJS, NPM and Git installed!_**

  
## Installation

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone X
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install - Make sure it's in the project folder (this process takes 30 ~ 50 seconds)
```

Take a test:

```sh
npm test - If nothing appears on the console, end the action and proceed to the next step (this process takes 05 ~ 15 seconds)
```

Start npm and run the application:

```sh
node server.js
```
 
  
## Test, Test, Test

I used the "npm test" itself to check bugs and fix any problems.
Recommendation: Turn the "npm test" command before running the application.
